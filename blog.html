                <h3><ul>LPU School of Hotel Management and Tourism featured in The Indian Express for industry-endorsed curriculum</ul></h3>
                <div class="blog_write">
                <p>The coronavirus pandemic and ensuing lockdown devastated the worldwide travel and hospitality industry. Once the Covid-induced lockdown got imposed, tourism-dependent industries were worse hit. Experts now agree that hygiene, safety, and health will be the industry’s priority. As the sector recalibrates with curfew and restrictions easing, institutes providing hospitality and tourism courses are back to business and updating their curriculum to attract students.

                    Recent coverage by ‘The Indian Express’ on ‘Tourism and hospitality institutes updating their curriculum for the post-Covid market’ featured the inputs of the Lovely Professional University School of Hotel Management and Tourism.

                    LPU School of Hotel Management and Tourism ranks among the best institutes for Hotel Management programs and has given the tourism industry the most exquisite hospitality management talents. Many schools in India offer hotel management as a degree, but LPU’s emphasis on practicality rather than learning philosophy is the aspect that makes it distinctive.

                    If we talk of the present and coming times, it’s apparent that the hotel management schools are rebuilding their course curriculum to meet the current necessities. As people are now more mindful of social distancing and sanitation, the hospitality and aviation industry will see an increased demand for hospitality management talents and employment in the aviation market. Discussing the same, Dr. Sanjay Modi (Executive Dean, LPU) said, “As individuals are gradually becoming aware of immunity, we’re adding a course on ‘Ayurveda food combinations’ to the curriculum of our hotel management program.” Adding further, Dr. Sanjay said, “Seeing the trends of the hospitality & aviation industries, we expect a rapid surge in the jobs. And thus, LPU has introduced BBA in Airlines and Airport Management from the current academic session.“

                    Last year was not a good year. Many lost lives, many got uprooted, and many saw their aspirations fall into pieces. It was such a devastating period that nobody expected, and obviously, none could help. But, at LPU, the placement records of hotel management and other students kept touching new heights. Even in pandemic times, the university placed students in MNCs and secured their lives. Dr. Sorabh Lakhanpal (Additional Dean, LPU) says things have changed, and now the companies demand more than academics from the students. The recruiters are more focused on food, healthy lifestyle for the creation of immunity. In the coming times, along with the traditional recruiters of management students, the FMCG sector is also hiring hospitality students. “Dieting and fitness businesses are approaching us to recruit chefs who can prepare recipes that improve immunity. It seems to be in demand for a menu that can include organic, fresh local ingredients cooked using conventional Indian techniques. A major section is health food. There has been a trend in how to sustain the lifestyle and avoid disorder, but it will now pick up more, and hence more jobs will be created in this segment,” he added.

                    The myths of a waiter job being hotel management are continuously broken by the university. LPU has given a new approach to the course, focusing on all the features of the hospitality area. Students will undoubtedly acquire a great deal during the range of the degree because of LPU’s wide range of educational programs and excellent experience.</p>

                <h3>Real Hero of Bollywood Biopic ‘Super 30’ Anand Kumar interacted with Students at LPU Campus</h3>
                <div class="blog_write">
                    <p>The real hero of Bollywood’s much talked about biopic “Super 30”, Ace Mathematician Prof Anand Kumar visited LPU campus where he interacted with thousands of LPU students. Prof Anand’s character has been enacted by none other than Bollywood’s top actor Hrithik Roshan, for which Hrithik is earning eclectic acclamations. The occasion was an educational programme ‘Shiksha’ organized by LPU students’ organization ‘Sankalp Enviro’, which aims to educate poor and slum-dwellers in nearby villages. While interacting with LPU students, Anand Kumar forwarded them many success-oriented key-liners to adopt in life. Talking about his poverty-ridden student life and various humane endeavours in spite of that, Anand shared many strength-providing and morale-boosting stories of his parents and younger brother in initial stages, and those of his students in later stages.
                    In spite of poor conditions at home, Anand has been running an innovative ‘Super 30’ programme for the last 18 years to mentor 30 students free of cost through year-long residential coaching for IIT JEE- the entrance examination for the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). The success rate has been outstanding, with students from underprivileged sections entering the premiere international institutions and companies. Here, he quoted the examples of auto-rickshaw driver’s daughter Nidhi Jha, slum-dwellers Abhishek Raj, Shashi Narayan and more. A teacher in the true sense of the words, Anand holds that an educated world would be much better placed due to greater understanding and compassion. Humbly, Anand shared: “Through Super 30, I have experienced how the smile of success on the faces of the learners brings cheers to both family and the community.” A top educational program in India, ‘Super 30’ was started in Patna (Bihar State) under the banner of Ramanujan School of Mathematics.
                    As LPU Management, Anand Kumar also thinks ‘to give back to society, and there can be no gift more precious than education’. He exhorted all teachers, parents and people to help education become the strongest weapon to fight all problems of the world, including corruption, poverty, unemployment, terrorism. Forwarding key-liners as crux from his life experiences, he asked students: “Dream big, think big, work hard and reach to innovation level. Always be in good company as it influences much to do the best in life. Everyone faces challenges, only will-power over-powers these.” He also advised students to read subjects by seeking answers to all ‘how’ and ‘why’ pertaining to these. Believing firmly in youth power, he invoked LPU students to always have patience and be strong change-makers in society. He informed students how he declined many times coveted offers to have donations for his school and to contest elections on symbols of reputed political parties.
                    Recognized as ancient India’s mythical and top Guru Dronacharya, Anand shared his father’s words with students: “Raja ka beta hi Raja kyu banega; Ab Raja woh banega, jo haqdaar hoga“. This version changed his mind and he persevered to do a lot for the entire society. His true calling from within and passion of a true teacher caught up with him, and he realized that he must use his skills to give lesser privileged, bright students, a fair chance at life. He also shared stories of his father being in humble postal service, his mother making “Papads” for livelihood, and his younger brother saving him from many evil designs of the oppressors. On this occasion, Executive Director Manish Gautam of ALS Chandigarh was accompanying Prof Anand. ALS has provided scholarship to 300 LPU students for Civil Services (IAS) exams coaching.
